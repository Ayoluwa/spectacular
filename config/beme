Between my fingers and my thumb
It rests so quiet and never dumb
Sliding and gliding on the open page
It keeps me busy in my bookish cage.

Its life flows from its fountain of ink
With which it makes the longest link
It pricks and probes with its nifty nibs
Its shiny tooth; its eloquent teeth

Digging and daring from the days of old
An ancient tool forever bold
A world of words from its fluent tongue
The magic of music, the endless song

In its inky fountain, there's a glowing fire.
We stoke it deep and it takes us higher
Silent warrior with thunderous words 
Forever mightier than the mightiest sword.


You're starting on life's journey
Along the grand high way of life.
You'll lead to thousands of temptations
Each city with evil is rife
The world is full of excitement
There's danger wherever you glowing
But if you're tempted in weakeness
Have courage to say No
